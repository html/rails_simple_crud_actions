RailsSimpleCrudActions
======================

This plugin is an action pack for "actions" framework (see http://github.com/html/actions)
It contains standard CRUD (index, new, edit, show, create, destroy, update) from standard rails scaffolding.


Example
=======

class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  action :index, :new, :edit, :show, :create, :destroy, :update
end

This is equal to have standard scaffolded controller ArticlesController.
